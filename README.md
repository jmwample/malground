# Simple Packer
This repo. will store a work area for a couple malware related ideas and may grow over time. 

#### Latest Update:
```
* Testing a simple packer (two stage XOR) to play around with self modifying code and encryption techniques. 
```
## Build:
Figure it out yourself. 

## Future:
* Object Oriented Packer - different encryption techniques
* OllyBonE style kernel module to detect Instruction cache page misses. 
* Automated unpacker
    * track all child processes spawned
    * Image process memory on instruction cache miss. 
    * Kill when full behavior is seen 
* Stream / Batch Processing models for malware analysis. 
    * VM allocation and management
    * Data processing 

## Style & Contributions:
1. Comments exist where they helped me. (Mostly debug)
2. Style is best effort for now.
